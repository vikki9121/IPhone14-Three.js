WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser. It is based on OpenGL ES, a graphics standard used in embedded systems such as smartphones and game consoles.

Three.js (also known as 3js) is a popular JavaScript library built on top of WebGL that simplifies the creation of 3D graphics for the web. It provides an easy-to-use API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, materials, lighting, and cameras. Three.js can be used to create a wide range of visual effects and interactive experiences, from simple 3D models to complex simulations and games.

Together, WebGL and Three.js enable developers to create high-quality, real-time 3D graphics that can be experienced directly in a web browser without the need for plugins or additional software. They are widely used in various fields, including gaming, architecture, scientific visualization, and virtual reality.
